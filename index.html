    Hola!! I'm Raj Thombare!
    It's my personal portfolio in making.
    I'm a Computer Science student at Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj University, Shedung-Panvel.
    currently i am in the 2nd year and has learnt alot in these 1 and 1/2 year.
    apart from coding and developing websites my hobbies are:
    1. Travelling
    2. Listening to Music
    3. Sports (especially Cricket)
    4. Games

    I have watched a series called '13 years why?' on Netflix which was the best ever series i had watched so far!!

    My dream is to study in Australia, do job their and get settle-down there!
    having a job in Foreign country specially in Australia is kind of a tough challenge but having said that i just need to focus on my basics, do hardwork cause someone has told me that there is no substitution for hardwork which i think is the best motivational quote as it is always in my mind!

    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <p>So, i will post my projects tomorrow!</p>

    Hobbies - To watch Movies, To travel entire india for now and then to travel internationaly.
